# RandomStudents

RandomStudents is intended to be a neat and easy-to-use programm
meant to be used by schools and other teaching facilities to group students into equal but random groups.

Key features are:
easy to use and understand
correct error handling
good randomness
equality to all students


It will be made in AutoIT at first.
Mostly becouse it's the language I can work well with.
It doesn't have any other reason.
